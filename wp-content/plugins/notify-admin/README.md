# Plugin template

This directory gives you a basic starting point for a class-based plugin, with unit tests, if you would like to use it.

To install the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

To run the unit tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit 
```

The tests are written in [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.5/), and use [WP_Mock](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock) to mock WordPress core functions.
